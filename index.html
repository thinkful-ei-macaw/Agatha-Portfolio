            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p class='genDescription'>In my opinion it's important to embrace one's good and bad. Following this principle has 
            never served me wrong, so I will continue to practice it professionally. Admitting to and being honest 
            about both your strengths and your weaknesses not only builds a relationship on a foundation 
            of truth, but it also serves as a better aid for seeing if someone fits into a team or on a specific
            project. We can sell ourselves all day, but without this element of truth I see hiring as a guessing game.
            So with all that in mind, here I am;</p>
            
            <h2>The Good</h2>
            
            <h3>I'm always creating.</h3> 
                <p>Whether it's coding and designing, writing, or preparing content for one of my 
                dungeons and dragons games, I spend my days making things. I was always the kid who would come out of 
                a toystore with new LEGOs or K'NEXs and frustrate my parents by opening it up and building right there
                in the car. I moved onto writing as a teenager, and eventually found a deep love of roleplaying games,
                which remain my primary hobby to this day. This thrust for creation brought me into the field of design and 
                code, and I trust my passion for it will only blossom further with time.</p>
            
            <h3>I'm punctual.</h3> 
                <p>Even if it isn't the most flashy of strengths, I personally value it to the highest degree.
                In all walks of life, perpetually late people stand out in a bad way. I think of my time as an extention of 
                everyone's time that I'm working or interacting with each day, and strive to never waste my peers precious
                efficiency by showing up late. On the contrary, if I can show up somewhere early then somewhere between 
                fifteen and thirty minutes is what I consider 'on time' and I feel uncomfortable showing up right on the dot.
                I do everything in my power to apply this to deadlines as well, making room for potential snags and issues.</p>
            
            
            <h2>The Bad</h2>
                
                <h3>I have a high opinion of myself.</h3> 
                <p>I'm not quite a narcissist, but I do have an ego. I'm not proud of it,
                but it's something I've always struggled with internally. I've gotten quite good at suppressing this aspect 
                of myself, and try to regularly humble and ground my ego to keep in check. I value self growth, and my ego is 
                my main blocker for it. I do feel I've become a stronger person over the years, in spite of this shortcoming, 
                and I continue to work on tempering myself.</p>
                
                <h3>I'm disinterested in social media</h3>
                <p>While I'm sure many would agree with this statement and not see it as a negative, I know that this line of
                work tends to favor people who can maximize their exposure while simultaniously networking. I just can't seem to
                reconcile with it, as hard as I've tried! It vexes me!</p>
