                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p class='genDescription'>In my opinion it's important to embrace one's good and bad. Following this principle has 
                never served me wrong, so I will continue to practice it professionally. Admitting to and being honest 
                about both your strengths and your weaknesses not only builds a relationship on a foundation 
                of truth, but it also serves as a better aid for seeing if someone fits into a team or on a specific
                project. We can sell ourselves all day, but without this element of truth I see hiring as a guessing game.
                So with all that in mind, here I am;</p>
            </div>

            <div class='left'>
                <h2 class='hleft'>The Good</h2>
                
                <h3 class='hleft'>I'm always creating.</h3> 
                    <p class='hleft'>Whether it's coding and designing, writing, or preparing content for one of my 
                    dungeons and dragons games, I spend my days making things. I was always the kid who would come out of 
                    a toystore with new LEGOs or K'NEXs and frustrate my parents by opening it up and building in the car. 
                    I moved onto writing as a teenager, and eventually found a deep love of roleplaying games,
                    which remain my primary hobby to this day. This thrist for creation brought me into the field of design and 
                    code.</p>
                
                <h3 class='hleft'>I'm punctual.</h3> 
                    <p class='hleft'>Even if it isn't the most flashy of strengths, I personally value it to the highest degree.
                    In all walks of life, perpetually late people stand out in a bad way. I think of my time as an extention of 
                    everyone's time that I'm working or interacting with each day, and strive to never waste my peers precious
                    efficiency by showing up late. I do everything in my power to apply this to deadlines as well, making room 
                    for potential snags and issues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='right'>
                <h2 class='hright'>The Bad</h2>
                
                <h3 class='hright'>I have a high opinion of myself.</h3> 
                <p class='hright'>I'm not quite a narcissist, but I do have an ego. I'm not proud of it,
                but it's something I've always struggled with internally. I've gotten quite good at suppressing this aspect 
                of myself, and try to regularly humble and ground my ego to keep in check. I value self growth, and my ego is 
                my main blocker for it. I do feel I've become a stronger person over the years, in spite of this shortcoming, 
                and I continue to work on tempering myself.</p>
                
                <h3 class='hright'>I'm disinterested in social media</h3>
                <p class='hright'>While I'm sure many would agree with this statement and not see it as a negative, I know that this line of
                work tends to favor people who can maximize their exposure while simultaniously networking. I just can't seem to
                reconcile with it, as hard as I've tried! It vexes me!</p>
